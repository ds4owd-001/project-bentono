Project description

The data is on renewable water resources and water access in Eastern Africa. My goal is to visualize the data and show the varying trends in the region.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

Import

```{r}
read_excel(here::here("data/raw/water_resources_east_africa_Bentono.xlsx"))
```
